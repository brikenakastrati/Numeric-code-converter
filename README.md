### About this project 
This C++ project specializes in encoding and decoding Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) codes utilizing diverse schemes, including NBCD, 84-2-1, and 5421. It offers robust functionality to seamlessly convert integers to their corresponding NBCD representation and vice versa. Furthermore, the project facilitates encoding and decoding operations using the 84-2-1 and 5421 encoding schemes.
I completed this project during my first year of studies.

## Key Features:

- IntToNBCD Functionality: Convert integers to NBCD format efficiently using the intToNBCD function.
- NBCDToInt Conversion: Decode NBCD strings back to integers with precision through the NBCDToInt function.
- 84-2-1 Encoding: Encode numbers into the 84-2-1 scheme effortlessly.
- 84-2-1 Decoding: Decode numbers from the 84-2-1 scheme accurately.
- 5421 Encoding: Perform encoding operations using the 5421 scheme seamlessly.
- 5421 Decoding: Decode numbers from the 5421 scheme with ease.
